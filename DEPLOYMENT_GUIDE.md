# Deployment Guide - Fix Video Connection Issues

## üîß Problem Summary
Your dating app has two main issues:
1. **Video not showing after peer connection** - Users connect but video doesn't appear
2. **Works on localhost but fails in production** - Deployment environment issues

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Enhanced WebRTC Configuration
Added production-ready TURN servers and improved ICE configuration:
- Multiple STUN servers for redundancy
- TURN servers for NAT traversal
- Enhanced connection policies

### 2. Video Display Fixes
- Added proper video autoplay and stream handling
- Enhanced debugging and error handling
- Fixed remote video display issues

### 3. Production Deployment Requirements
- HTTPS enforcement (required for WebRTC)
- Proper media constraints for cross-device compatibility

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to HTTPS Server
WebRTC requires HTTPS in production. Use any of these platforms:

**Firebase Hosting (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

**Netlify**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Deploy automatically

**Vercel**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Step 2: Update Firebase Configuration
Ensure your Firebase config in `app.js` and `auth.js` uses your actual project credentials.

### Step 3: Test Video Connection
After deployment:
1. Open the app on two different devices/networks
2. Start video on both devices
3. Click "Connect" to find a match
4. Verify video appears for both users

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Video not displaying:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled
- Verify camera/microphone permissions

**Connection failed:**
- Check if TURN servers are accessible
- Verify firewall settings
- Test on different networks

**Black screen:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if remote user has started their video
- Verify stream is being received

### Debug Mode
Open browser console to see detailed WebRTC logs including:
- Connection states
- ICE candidates
- Stream information
- Error messages

## üì± Browser Compatibility

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

**Required Features:**
- WebRTC support
- getUserMedia API
- HTTPS (production only)

## üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy to HTTPS server
- [ ] Test on localhost (should work)
- [ ] Test on production HTTPS
- [ ] Test video between different networks
- [ ] Test chat functionality
- [ ] Test user matching
- [ ] Check error handling

## üö® Important Notes

1. **HTTPS is mandatory** for WebRTC in production
2. **Camera permissions** must be granted by users
3. **TURN servers** are provided for free but have usage limits
4. **Mobile browsers** may require user interaction to autoplay video

## üìû Support

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your Firebase configuration
3. Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
4. Test with different browsers/devices
